% TODO
% Train the R-CNN based on your extracted features
% Things to be careful about:
% -What threshold should you use for hard negatives?
% -What overlap with ground truth should count as positive?
% -What overlap with ground truth should count as negative?
% -How often should the detector be re-trained?
% -What type of feature normalization should you do?
% -Should you use any regularization?
% -How many epochs over the data should you do?
% -Should you train all classes at once or do them one at a time?
% -Should you use a bias?
% -What type of SVM solver/formulation should you use?
